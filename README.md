# Question: How do you simulate a basic Promise.all() behavior manually? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code simulates the behavior of Promise.all() manually. The function `promiseAll` takes an array of promises as an argument. It returns a new promise that is resolved when all the promises in the input array are resolved, or rejected as soon as one of the promises in the array is rejected. Inside the function, an empty results array and a count variable are initialized. Then, for each promise in the input array, a `.then()` method is attached to handle the resolution of the promise. When a promise is resolved, its value is stored in the results array at the corresponding index, and the count is incremented. If the count equals the length of the promises array, it means all promises have been resolved, and the new promise is resolved with the results array. If any promise is rejected, the `.catch()` method is triggered, and the new promise is rejected with the error from the rejected promise. The test at the end of the code demonstrates the function's usage and expected output.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version. Both versions define a function `promiseAll` that takes an array of promises and returns a new promise that resolves when all the input promises have resolved, or rejects as soon as one of the input promises rejects. The resolved value of the `promiseAll` promise is an array of the resolved values of the input promises, in the same order as the input promises.

The main difference between the two versions is that the TypeScript version uses TypeScript's static typing. The function `promiseAll` is explicitly typed to take an array of promises (`Promise<any>[]`) and return a promise that resolves to an array (`Promise<any[]>`). The variable `results` is explicitly typed as an array (`any[]`). This can help catch type-related errors at compile time.

Another difference is that the TypeScript version includes a check at the beginning of the `promiseAll` function to immediately resolve the returned promise if the input array is empty. This is not present in the JavaScript version.

The TypeScript version also uses a decrementing counter (`count--`) to track the number of unresolved promises, while the JavaScript version uses an incrementing counter (`count++`). This doesn't change the functionality, it's just a different way of achieving the same result.

Finally, the test promises in the TypeScript version are all created with `new Promise` and `setTimeout`, while the JavaScript version includes a promise created with `Promise.resolve` and a non-promise value. This doesn't affect the functionality of the `promiseAll` function, it's just a difference in the test cases.

# C++ Differences

The JavaScript version of the solution uses the Promise object, which is a built-in feature of JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. It creates a new Promise that resolves when all the promises in the input array have resolved, or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the array rejects. The .then() and .catch() methods are used to handle the resolution and rejection of each promise, respectively.

The C++ version, on the other hand, uses the std::future and std::async features of C++ to handle asynchronous operations. std::future is a promise-like object that can hold a value that may be computed in the future. std::async is a function that can run a function asynchronously (potentially in a separate thread) and returns a std::future representing the result of that function.

The C++ version of the solution does not have a direct equivalent to the Promise.all() behavior in JavaScript. Instead, it simply waits for each future in the input vector to resolve in order, and collects the results in a vector. This means that if one of the futures takes a long time to resolve, it could block the others from resolving, which is not the case with Promise.all() in JavaScript.

In terms of language features, JavaScript's Promise is a high-level abstraction for handling asynchronous operations, with built-in support for chaining and error handling. C++'s std::future and std::async are lower-level features that provide more control over the execution of asynchronous operations, but require more boilerplate code to use.
